## About
The main goal of this is to get a chain of words, a size of a grid and a word to searchon the grid.With those inputs the code prints on console the chain in form of a grid with the size you gave to it.
If the program finds the word, it outputs the grid and the letters of the word onn the grid will appear in capital letters. If not, then it will send a message that the word is not on the grid. The word to find 
shoud be on the grid in the right order from right to left and it does not care if there are some letters in the middle. If the word is scrammbled on the grid it will not find it.

## Usage
The parameters are the following: 
- Chain of words (mandatory)
- Word to search (optional)
- Grid size (optional)

If you only give the chain of words, the program has a default grid size and will ask you for a word to search.
